# Bramble website

Static public website for Bramble, the Starknet browser-extension wallet.

```bash
bun run --filter @mc-wallet/website dev
bun run --filter @mc-wallet/website check
```

The Vite build writes `apps/website/dist/` with real `/`, `/docs/`, `/support/`, and `/privacy/`
entry documents. Set `VITE_CHROME_STORE_URL` to the exact Bramble listing URL before deployment.
Until that URL is configured, download links lead to the Chrome Web Store root instead of guessing
an item identifier.

## Deployment

The site is served from the Cloudflare Worker `bramble` at <https://bramble.money>, configured by
`wrangler.jsonc` in this directory (assets-only, no server-side code, `workers.dev` and preview
URLs disabled). `.github/workflows/website-deploy.yml` deploys it on every push to the active
release branch that touches `apps/website/`, and on manual dispatch. Pull requests never deploy;
they are checked by `check:workspaces` in the main CI workflow.

The workflow needs one secret, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, in the `bramble-production` GitHub
environment: a Cloudflare token with Account → Workers Scripts → Edit only. The account id is
public and lives in the workflow file.

To deploy by hand from an authenticated shell, run the same commands the workflow does:

```bash
bun run --filter @mc-wallet/website check
bun run --filter @mc-wallet/website deploy
```

Keep `name` in `wrangler.jsonc` as `bramble`: a different name deploys a new Worker and leaves the
live site unchanged.
